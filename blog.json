A perfect home for me to grow healthy and full of love before my furrever home. I got to ride on daddy's lap the whole way home. I was a little nervous being in a car for the first time but daddy kept petting me and telling me it was all ok. He was right! We ended up at my home in Long Beach, California. Now it's time to live the beach life I was born to live. Until next time!\n\nCooper out...",
