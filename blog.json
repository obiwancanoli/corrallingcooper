A perfect home for me to grow healthy and full of love before my furrever home. I got to ride on daddy's lap the whole way home. I was a little nervous being in a car for the first time but daddy kept petting me and telling me it was all ok. He was right! We ended up at my home in Long Beach, California. Now it's time to live the beach life I was born to live. Until next time! Cooper out...",

I was a nervous Nelly at the beginning but she made me feel cozy and then began to cut all my fur off! I was looking like a raggamuffin so it was about time. Now I am a distinguished looking gentleman. Until next time! Cooper out...",
